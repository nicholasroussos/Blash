	<h3 class="text-center header-instructor">Michael Morris</h3>
	<p class="para-indent">Mr. Morris is the instructor for both the Fairhope and Gulf Shores school. He has been teaching Taekwondo for 35 years. It has been a labor of love for him. He has trained since 1978. He won a Taekwondo National Championship in 1984. He describes it as the moment that stands out the most during his competing youth. After winning Mr. Morris continued to compete for some years, until he eventually began teaching. Currently, he holds a 7th degree black belt. The three core principles of his practice are: instilling confidence, forming discipline, and achieving the student's best. Mr. Morris's schools have family friendly Taekwondo hours for children, while also scheduling classes for adults.</p>
	<p class="para-indent">Mr. Morris may sometimes defer the teaching of his classes to his son Bobby Morris. Bobby is also a black belt and has been studying since he has a child. In the above picture we can see Bobby when he was 5 years old.</p>
	<p class="para-indent">Classes include the following: kicking and punching drills, freestyel and controlled sparring, Taekwondo form practice, and self defence training. Class is not structured beforehand, rather it is dynamic according to the students. </p>

Over the years, TU has established a reputation built upon this standard of excellence, accordingly, we do not allow negative attitudes, aggressive behavior, or any misuse of Taekwondo in any manner.
